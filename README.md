# Haroldo's Portfolio - Android App

Development Overview -> *Native/Webviews Android App - Java, HTML, XML, SQLite*

Yes, I’ve decided to build my entire portfolio as an Android App.

It uses WebViews, HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a light and efficient approach.

I know it’s a little over the top, but I figured to practice custom graphics and in-app search, at the same time as putting out a more elegant portfolio.
