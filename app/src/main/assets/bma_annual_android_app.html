        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>BMA Annual - Android App</p>
        <p font16>
            An Android App with the list of all BMA Conferences, starting with the 2015 Conference.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            The 2015 conference's SQLite data is currently preloaded with the App, allowing them to choose schedule items they want and take notes.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            Their personal items (like My Schedule, My Sessions and My Handouts) and notes are stored locally in SQLite. Once more conferences get released, the App will offer to download the latest conference, which will add to the initial list that, at the moment, only contains one conference, so the App queries a custom made web-service every time it's launched to see if there is a new conference available for download.
