        <p font16>
            It's a Core Banking Systems commercial website, which intends also makes a cross-domain request to load an independent web based Project Request System, which was originally built in Cold Fusion and currently maintained by me.

            This website uses jQuery and custom JavaScript modules, depending on the page.

            Most of the design was specified by my employer, however some of the art and website colors and transparency was suggested by me.

            I have built this website ready to be incorporated with mobiles Apps, so there is a web server ready for that.
