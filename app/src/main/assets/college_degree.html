        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>College Degree</p>
        <p font16 bold>Federal Center of Technologic Education</p>
        <p font16>Graduated in 1999 and had a lot of great experiences being a programming teacher's assistant.</p>
        <p font16>I've spent many weekends developing my own database engines, creating tables, reading, changing and deleting records.</p>
        <p font16>Other programming development include custom 3D implementation, video cards controllers, mouse controllers, parallel and serial printers controllers, soundcards controllers. All these modules were eventually used commercially as part of a bigger software package to attend the needs of my customers.</p>
        <p font16>I was a volunteer tutor for the weekends' computer labs study groups.</p>
