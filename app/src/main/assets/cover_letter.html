        <p font16>To whom it may concern,</p>
        <p font16>My experience as a Software Developer has afforded me the opportunity to become familiar with several programming languages.</p>
        <p font16>Currently, I'm an Android/iOS Software Engineer, responsible to upgrade existing apps using Native development.</p>
        <p font16>On the iOS side, I use Xcode with Swift and Objective C, NIBs and Storyboards.</p>
        <p font16>On the Android side, I use Android Studio with Java. I've started converting the latest modified code to Kotlin as well.</p>
        <p font16>In my previous position as Programmer/Analyst, I am responsible for Apache/Zend Server administration and security certificates implementation. Develop most of our platform under LAMP, with DB2 being our main database engine. </p>
        <p font16>I'm a certified Microsoft Azure Developer Associate, and I have done some Microsoft Azure development for my current employer, both on the Visual Studio side, as well as on the Azure Portal.</p>
        <p font16>Thank you for your interest in my Portfolio.</p>
        <p font16>Sincerely,<br/><span font20 bold italic>Haroldo Paulino</span></p>
