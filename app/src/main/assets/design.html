            <span font16>It's Photoshop's biggest competitor, a full featured graphic design software suite that I've used since 1995.</span><br/>

            <span font16>
                Before I've decided to adopt Corel Draw as my standard platform, I was a Photoshop nerd, however, due to license pricing, I chose to go with Corel Draw since 1995.<br/>

                I think it's a lot of fun to do 3D modeling.<br/>
                The feeling of making a 3D animation come to life is great, such a pleasure!

            <span font16>
                I have been designing most of BMA's merchandise art, including lip balm, breath spray, headphones, tablets, hand sanitizers, suncreens, newsletters, golf tournament, website and landing page.<br/>
                Adhering to strict design guidelines for each product, I've been having a good taste of what it takes to design for real products, with specific sizes and shapes, which require the art to be especially made for that purpose.<br/>
                Enjoyable, to say the least.<br/>
                Who gets to carry around products that carries your own art design? Is that awesome or what?
