            Since 1999
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>The majority of my career has been one project after another, which is absolutely great and keeps me going.</li>
            <li>I've managed over 30 projects for various clients, sometimes I was given a group of programmers, other times I recruited my own team, maybe even part-time managing a Copy Center with some great employees at the time.</li>
            <li>My biggest project was to convert a large brazilian bank MS-DOS based system into Web based. I was given 3 programmers and had to recruit 5 of my own. Since I was the Project Manager and Programmer, I had a blast with my team. The same system has evolved a lot since then and it's running in branches accross Brazil today.</li>
            <li>Throughout the years I've managed programmers, computer technicians and a Copy Center.</li>
            <li>After working with some many teams and going through the all phases of the projects, I see them as family. It's a great feeling.</li>

            Since 2011 - Android is awesome!
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>I fell in love with Android from the very beginning. It's like the perfect playground for forward thinking programmers.</li>
            <li>I started from the ground up, reading hundreds of Android pages online, which these days are nicely documented and structured by Google and the Android community.</li>
            <li>Among many topics, my Android experience includes Activities, Fragments, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Google Cloud Messaging, Custom Graphics Implementation, 9-Patch Composing, Battery Optimization, SQLiteOpenHelper and Sensors.</li>
            <li>Please check out some of my Android projects within my Work Samples.</li>

            Since 2015 - iOS is unique
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Xcode is such a great IDE, full of solid features that we can always count on. It is such a pleasure to exercise my brain with Swift 2.</li>
            <li>Most of my experience come from Playgrounds and the Cocoa Application Layer, however, I will soon be publishing some of my own iOS Apps.</li>
        </ol>
        <p font20 bold paddingTop50 fullWidth left>Web Programming</p>
        <p font16 bold>
            Since 2000 - I've embraced the new era of programming: WEB
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Converted some of my programs into PHP, HTML and JavaScript.</li>
            <li>I started accessing the same database from my programs and my web applications, and that's when I learned about database locks and realized that I would need to configure each database carefully, so my applications wouldn't lock.</li>
            <li>Later learned CSS and the Prototype JavaScript Framework, as well as jQuery.</li>
            <li>Recently I've learned CSS Media Queries, also playing with AngularJS.</li>
            <li>HTML5 compatibility throughout web browsers has been a rocky road, but I absolutely find it fascinating.</li>
        </ol>
        <p font20 bold paddingTop50 fullWidth left>Desktop Programming</p>
        <p font16 bold>
            Since 2008 - My first real OOP language: Java
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Built some applets in order to replace some HTML rendering and handle a lot more data. For example, my Java Protogrid is a table applet that can be loaded from JavaScript or it can connect directly to a DB2 database and retrieve data on demand without paralysing the page and it can easily handle 200.000 rows and still be stable with sorting capabilites, filtering, printing and exporting the data into different file formats, right off the applet itself.</li>
            <li>Since my very beginning in Java, I needed multiple concurrent threads, so each process consumes it's own resources and does not lock the main thread. Java concurrency has been a great experience, which shows the real power of devices with multiprocessing capabilites.</li>
            <li>Learned how to properly use database access drivers to directly communicate with databases like IBM DB2, MySQL, SQL and ODBC based access.</li>
            <li>I've become very familiar with the JTOpen API, which gives me the capability to perform an enormous array of IBM AS400 tasks. Such functionality </li>
        </ol>
        <p font16 bold>
            Since 1998 - I started programming in Delphi professionally
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Being an even higher level language than Pascal, I really thought that nothing could ever come close to it.</li>
            <li>Learned how to design for programs for windows based desktop operating systems, more specifically Windows and Linux Mandrake.</li>
            <li>I was exposed to great database engines, like MySQL, Paradox, Interbase, Sybase, DBase and learned that I wouldn't need my own custom database engine anymore.</li>
            <li>Learned to programatically use the registry in Microsft Windows, that I could store and retrieve values from it, so the data was actually shared between database and registry.</li>
            <li>Deployed several of commercial software, mostly storefront database driven, but some of them also controlled matrix printers, especially Epson LX300, most commercial grade printers, where some of them were used to print on fabric.</li>
            <li>Implemented a Fax API, so some of my programs could actualy send/receive faxes. I kind of miss the modem's dial up sound.</li>
            <li>I built a program that managed MP3 audio collections, playlists, randomizations and parallel sound stamp. It was sold to 3 radio stations and it was my first parallels program I've built, so it could play up to three audio track at the same time, so a few seconds before a song ended, the next would start playing in overlap and many times the radio station would schedule the station's stamp at the same time. It was quite nice knowing that those radio stations were using my software to run their business. I made heavy use of soundcards channels, along with all the sound settings commonly available.</li>
            <li>So I could remotely troubleshoot issues whenever they came up, I built a peer-to-peer module, so I could remotely get full system diagnostics using my personal diagnostic tool and attempt to determine what the cause of the problem was.</li>
        </ol>
        <p font16 bold>
            Since 1997 - I started programming in Pascal
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Being a higher level language, I thought I've conquered the world and immediately started writing my own VGA interface and ended up sharing with the school.</li>
            <li>Figured out how to start the video card's high resolution mode by loading downloaded drivers manually, since Windows 3.1 had just come out.</li>
            <li>I wrote my own database engine, creating record files and performing all the basic database functionality.</li>
            <li>Wrote several database commercial applications using my custom engine. I sold and maintained those programs for several years after.</li>
            <li>I implemented my first OOP using Pascal, it was the big hit in programming at the time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p font16 bold>
            Since 1996 - I started with Assembly in College
        </p>
        <ol type="I" font16>
            <li>Interacting directly with the hardware by turning on/off parallel port individual pins.</li>
            <li>Generating specific sounds frequencies using the old internal PC speakers. Those speakers are mostly gone in today's devices.</li>
            <li>Changing the keyboard's keys statuses, such as CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK.</li>
            <li>Wiped my computer's BIOS at the time. It took me a great deal of effort to redownload the BIOS from the manufacturer's website and upload back into the motherboard's BIOS. As you can tell, some of my playtime was a little scary.</li>
        </ol>
