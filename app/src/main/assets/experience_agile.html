        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>On the go</p>
        <p font16>It has been fun to work in an Agile development setting for the past 8 years.<p>
        <p font16>The benefits from such methodology involve adjusting course of action sooner, optimizing productivity and having more realistic deadlines.<p>
        <p font16>Since all the parties get constant updates, management does have fair certainty of when the project will be completed.<p>
        <p font16>Let's face it, we are humans and we do make mistakes both in planning and development, but either one can be corrected sooner when Agile is followed.<p>
        <p font16>Of course, if all the phases of development have been carefully executed without Agile, the project may also have great outcomes.<p>
