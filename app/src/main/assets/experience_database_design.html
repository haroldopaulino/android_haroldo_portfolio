        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Real world experience</p>
        <p font16>After so many years working with hundreds of databases, I've learned so much about what works and what does not.<p>
        <p font16>When accessing and modifying data, often I have to worry about many different aspects because the database designer had done little or no planning, which in turn makes things more challenging than they have to be.<p>
        <p font16>At that point, I began digging into database design, so I could suggest appropriate optimizations, so the system runs more efficiently, sometimes avoiding unnecessary hardware upgrades.<p>
        <p font16>Right out of college in 1999, I didn't really care much about proper database design, however, as I was exposed to many database engines and had to develop systems that used all kinds of designs.<p>
        <p font16>Knowing the ups and downs of so many approaches gives me the edge to work under a great database design or under less than ideal circumstances.<p>
