        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Understanding</p>
        <p font16>Working with so many databases' engines, under different operating systems, network setups and hardware.<p>
        <p font16>From every data experience I've learned a lesson, understood a little more about their intrincacies, the small things.<p>
        <p font16>I cannot claim to be a database expert by any means, but I do have enough knowledge and exposure that I get the whole picture in a very short period.<p>
        <p font16>Since almost everything that I have ever worked on has been database driven, becoming familiar with them was only natural for me.<p>
        <p font16>Besides, databases are fun to work with.<p>
