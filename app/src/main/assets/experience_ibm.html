        <p font16>After working with IBM servers for 8 straight years, I've become quite familiar with the web/mobile development side of things.<p>
        <p font16>Another language that has incredible abilities in the IBM i world is Java, so that has been one of my main focus as well.<p>
        <p font16>I had the privilege to build numerous Java applications, using various APIs and for different purposes.<p>
        <p font16>If there is one quality of IBM I feel I should mention, that is reliability, given the fact that I've never seen a IBM i server crash.<p>
