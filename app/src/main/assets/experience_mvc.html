        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Great architecture</p>
        <p font16>I have been implementing MVC in almost all the projects I am involved with, unless I am required not to.<p>
        <p font16>This truly such an amazing software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces and having a better handle on the development.<p>
        <p font16>It promotes team work and ease of code maintenance when properly implemented, to the point where developers are delighted to maintain one another's code.<p>
        <p font16>When I look back at the many roads that led me all the way from procedural to MVC, it's makes me realize how much growth was involved in the process.<p>
        <p font16>The knowledge and experience has continually changed my perspective as a professional.<p>
