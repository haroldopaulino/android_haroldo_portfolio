        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>OOP</p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>A basic requirement</p>
        <p font16>For many years I've worked with Object Oriented Programming and have realized it's potential early in my carreer.<p>
        <p font16>I find it empowering and the most important first step to be taken when developing.<p>
        <p font16>A well thought object architecture can account for every possible need, avoiding rudimentary practices such as procedural and singletons, because "making something global to avoid passing it around is a code smell".<p>
        <p font16>Object Oriented planning is not only good practice, but a necessity to any enterprise scale application.<p>
        <p font16>I am a big fan of OOP.<p>
