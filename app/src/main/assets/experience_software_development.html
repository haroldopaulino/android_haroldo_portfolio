        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Got it down</p>
        <p font16>I've been involved with all phases of development of new systems or upgrading existing ones.<p>
        <p font16>All the way from the planning stage, prototyping, developing, testing and deployment, Software Development has been my main focus since 1995.<p>
        <p font16>Either development approaches I was a part of, being traditional such as waterfall, life cycle with distinct phases or Agile, it was always great to create something new or revamp an existing system.<p>
