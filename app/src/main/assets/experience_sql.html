        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>A Must-have</p>
        <p font16>To be able to work with SQL is almost required these days, in virtually every development position.<p>
        <p font16>I am particularly fan of functions and stored procedures, because they make future SQL more powerful and easier to maintain.<p>
        <p font16>There is nothing like well written SQL statements that drives vital transactions and/or reports.<p>
        <p font16>It's like a work of art!<p>
