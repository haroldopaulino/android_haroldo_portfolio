            I consider myself very lucky, especially when it comes to staying on task, recognizing when to limit distractions and get my assignment done.

            Deviating is not something to be taken lightly, of course I do have a really good understanding about it since I have managed so many projects and dealt with all the ups and downs that come from the lack of focus.

            At some point, I started noticing the clear difference between those that would absolutely focus on their tasks and those who wouldn't.

            I am a big fan of social psychology, understanding our behaviour, strenghts and weaknesses. Such knowledge has helped me to get to know myself, giving me the courage to purposefully make forward thinking decisions.
