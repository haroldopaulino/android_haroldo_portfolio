        <p font16>
            I was a contestant in the “2015 LDS App and Game Contest”, where I developed this Android App in which a church Sunday School teacher will control all of the students “Gospel in Sync App”, so those students with babies or less proficient with modern technology can simply watch their App constantly get synchronized with the teacher's App, thus allowing them to follow the lesson without struggles.

            It makes heavy use of Google Cloud Messaging, SQLite, Web Service and Synchronization. I haven't had the chance to migrate from GCM to Firebase yet, so it was removed from the Google Play Store because of the deprecations.
