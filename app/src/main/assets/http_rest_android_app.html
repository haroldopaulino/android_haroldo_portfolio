        <p font16>
            This app is a tool for testing HTTP and REST services.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            HTTP methods include Get, Post, Options, Head, Put, Delete and Trace.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            The response is timed and all the data from the call is displayed, so you can measure the service performance with accuracy.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This app was written in Java, OOP, exploring async executions, abstraction, SQLite and accessing the device's GPS location.
