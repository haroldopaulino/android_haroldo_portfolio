        <p font16>
            It's a Home Inspection business Android App, which provides comprehensive information about their business, terms and conditions, credibility, references and qualifications.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This App is solely based in Fragments, Webviews and some custom tabs.

        <p font16>
            The contact and quote forms communicate with a custom web service, which then stores the data in a private server and sends the business an email about it.
