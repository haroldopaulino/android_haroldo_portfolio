        <p font16>
            It's a Home Inspection business website, which provides comprehensive information about their business, terms and conditions, credibility, references and qualifications.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This responsive website uses jQuery, imports an external Google font, makes heavy use of CSS selectors.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            I've either designed the art or customized the jQuery UI theme; Patrice Paulino, my wife, has taken all other professional pictures.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            It was fun to design with mobile integration in mind, since the Android App is currently using the custom web service to exchange data with the website.
