        <p font16>
            An Android App that allows users to create companies in which the administrators enroll problems/solutions and employees can search and view them.

        <p font16>
            Depending on the login, data is downloaded from a custom web-service into the device's local SQLite tables.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This App offers language selection of four languages: English, Spanish, French or Portuguese.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            Once the user chooses one, it gets stored in an SQLite local database, so the user does not have to select it again, unless another language selection is needed.
