        <p font16>
            The ability to communicate with a variety of people, getting on the same page has been a crucial part of my life.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            My favorite technique is to keep it simple. Why complicate when is not necessary?
        </p>

            Listening is an art form I am good at, because by having a really good grasp on the other person's message I can make educated decisions that will directly affect my work performance and quality.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            As bilingual, I can see the virtue in taking the appropriate time to listen with ears, mind and eyes.
        </p>

            Since most of us are visual driven, I am a big fan of sketching ideas, knowing that the visual, combined with the message beyond the words, brings clarity of understanding.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            I try my hardest to never underestimate the power that clear, concise communication can have in my life and those I come in contact with, especially at work.
