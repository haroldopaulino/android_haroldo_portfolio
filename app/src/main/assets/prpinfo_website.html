        <p font16>
            I host this website in my private web server in my house. I also manage the DNS and SSL implementation and renewal.

        <p font16>
            An IT Services company website that I've developed several years ago.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This website uses jQuery and custom JavaScript modules, depending on the page.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            The design was inherited either from previous projects or newly created by me.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            I have built this website ready to be incorporated with mobiles Apps, so there is a web server ready for that.</span><br/>
