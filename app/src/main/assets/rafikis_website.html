            I host this website in my private web server in my house. I also manage the DNS and SSL implementation and renewal.

            This non-profit organization approached me several years back about getting this website done as my donation to their cause, so I've accepted the challenge and it has served them ever since.

            My wife has sponsored a couple of kids in Kenya for quite a few years, paying for their education, so I guess I can say I was a sponsor too ;)

            I used Prototype and lots of manual HTML and inline CSS. It shows how much I've progressed as a web programmer when you compare it to the J-Pro Inspects website.

            They've given me the actual pictures and I've designed the entire website, including the Paypal integration.

            Like any project I've been involved with, it increased my experience and exposed some of the things I had to work on. It was a great eye opener, of course, beyond being fun and exciting.
