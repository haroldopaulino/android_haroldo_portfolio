        <p><span font20 bold>Alan Dee</span><br/><span font16 italic>Sr. Software Developer at Savage Services</span><br/></p>
        <p font16>Harold is an extremely dedicated programmer.<br/>
        He loves to try new things and is a wonderful team member.<br/>
        Even though his education isn't from a US institution, he knows just as much, or more, then many college graduates.<br/>
        I've seen him work on side projects for the company in his spare time because he enjoys it.<br/>
        Harold will fit in best in a small team of Java developers.<br/>
        Harold is very flexible and very adaptable.<br/>
        It would be a pleasure to work with him again.</p>
        <p font16 italic>April 23, 2011, Alan worked directly with Harold at Equitable Life & Casualty</p>
