        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Professionally</p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            Going all the way back to high school, I've realized that whenever I did only the bare minimum of a certain task, like homework or projects, my teachers would simply nod and say a very boring "good job".
        </p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            However, if I went above and beyond and did my personal best, they would say a slow and well toned "well done!".
        </p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            Of course, I always wanted the earn the highest compliment, so it became a bit of my personal challenge to always give my best in whatever I do.
        </p>

            Needless to say, college was a blast and so has been my professional life.

        <p font20 bold paddingTop50 fullWidth left>Personally</p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            I've realized that you cannot be someone at home and someone completely different at work. At one point a lot of those traits will cross over to one side or the other.
        </p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            My self-initiative starts at home, where I dedicate as much as possible to spending time with my family, progressing, learning, becoming a better human being.
        </p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            My personal goal is to keep yourself going, because idleness only encourages even more idleness.
        </p>
        <p font16 fullWidth left>
            Another factor is becoming a parent, where my children pay very close attention to the things I do or say, so I try even harder to be a good example to my entire family, so they know what a life of honest hard work is worth.
