        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>ANDROID DEVELOPMENT</p>
        <p font16>I've started in June of 2011, by making a “Quick Notes” app that allows using the camera to take a picture and attach to each note.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Test Driven Development</p>
        <p font16>I've worked in Agile environments off and on for many years, but consistently the last 6 years. TDD is not only expected, but required in almost all projects I am involved in.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Support Library, ActionBarSherlock</p>
        <p font16>In April of 2013, I was assigned to build an app that allowed life insurance sales persons to fill out the appropriate forms (through the app) and get signatures with legal binding, then send the data to our database via web-service with the form data and PNGs with signatures attached. It had to be compatible with older devices and look consistent (project requirement).<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Android and web services</p>
        <p font16>Either developing for Windows desktop, web or mobile programming, I've always used web-services to communicate with the server and exchange data. It's a crucial part of the majority of the projects I've been involved with.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Support both phones and tablets</p>
        <p font16>Since my very first project, the requirements were to support both phones and tablets, so I've always had to design my own drawables for each density and, of course, all my mipmaps.<p>
