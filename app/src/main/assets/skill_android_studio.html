        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>ANDROID STUDIO</p>
        <p font16>I've started using Android Studio since the early preview stage when it was first released.<p>
        <p font16>I was fortunate enough to see each added added/upgraded feature from release to release and see the difference in my apps.<p>
        <p font16>The advantage of having such a close relationship with the IDE is that I am able to solve issues faster and more comfortably.<p>
        <p font16>Android Studio has come a long way and it's more robust than ever. I love it!<p>
