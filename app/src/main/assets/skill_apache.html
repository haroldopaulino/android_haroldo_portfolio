        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Early Adoption</p>
        <p font16>My experience with this software dates all the way back to 2000, when I used to manually download the packages necessary to run it into various Linux servers, so I could implement my first web systems.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Enterprise Application</p>
        <p font16>I was beginning to convert MS-DOS and Windows Desktop based applications into web based right when PHP was first released.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Stability</p>
        <p font16>It wasn't long before I realized how solid Apache HTTP Server was becoming and the realization of dynamic webpages opened a whole new world of development ahead of me.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Configuration</p>
        <p font16>Throughout all these years, I have had the need to customize several settings, fine tunning, optimizing for specific workloads.<p>
        <p font16>The great majority of such customizations were the fruit of personal research, common sense and dedication.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Currently</p>
        <p font16>I have Apache HTTP Server running on my personal web server in my house. I just can't get enough of it.<p>
