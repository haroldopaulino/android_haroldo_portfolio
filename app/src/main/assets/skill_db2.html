        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>DB2</p>
        <p font16>My exposure to DB2 on a daily basis has been consistent since 2009.<p>
        <p font16>All the way from designing functions, stored procedures and rich SQL statements.<p>
        <p font16>When using stored procedures, I was able to call external Java and RPG programs in order to get or set the data according to my assignment needs.<p>
        <p font16>Working with DB2 has been a blast!<p>
