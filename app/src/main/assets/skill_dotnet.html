        <p font16>I've completed a few .NET projects in 2014, as I was working for BMA Corporation. My projects centered around building Remote Print Servers, which managed printers in a number of customers (various Bank Branches).<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>IIS</p>
        <p font16>Building Print Managers made realize how powerful IIS really is. I've setup websites, SSL and controlled printers hardware, all using .NET and IIS.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Visual Studio</p>
        <p font16>Through 2020 and 2021, I've developed a full Solution, which made RESTful calls to an external server to get data, then post to a target database, then send the response back to the client. Attaching debuggers and developing within the .NET ecosystem was such a rewarding experience.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Azure Portal</p>
        <p font16>Microsoft has really developed a very strong environment for management/development. All in one place. The countless features and possibilities make using Azure Portal the ultimate development experience. From creating Notification Hubs to handle all mobile notifications, to designing databases, with a comprehensive dashboard that keeps you well informed for what you need to pay attention to make you service even better, all the time.<p>
