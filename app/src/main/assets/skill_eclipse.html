        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Great IDE</p>
        <p font16>I've adopted Eclipse for a number of languages as I write code, including Java, PHP, JavaScript among others.<p>
        <p font16>The predictive text is great, scope recognition and very reliable.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Plugins</p>
        <p font16>Before Android Studio came out, I used to develop my Android apps through Eclipse, by installing the appropriate plugins.<p>
        <p font16>It was a great experience, however Google strongly advised that Eclipse Android developers should switch to Android Studio, so I did, but I know Eclipse is a great tool.<p>
