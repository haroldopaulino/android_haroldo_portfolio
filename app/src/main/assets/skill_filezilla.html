        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Handy FTP Application</p>
        <p font16>The biggest strength is the cross platform distribution, where I can continue my projects either from my Windows, Mac OS and Linux.<p>
        <p font16>The ability I have to use FTP, SFTP and FTPS is crucial in my line of work.<p>
        <p font16>Since I do support some systems in Brazil, it is great that FileZilla is translated into some many languages, including Portuguese.<p>
