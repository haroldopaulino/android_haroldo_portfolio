        <p font16>I have been developing web-based system since 2000.<p>
        <p font16>The evolution of web development has been a blast, because I got to see javascript framerworks evolve, as well as CSS and browser support.<p>
        <p font16>I started making menus and everything else with native javascript and very basic CSS, when things took a lot more work than it would today.<p>
        <p font16>It sure is nice to see modern frameworks making development more efficient and scalable.<p>
        <p font16>HTML5 has some amazing features, especially for input fields and streaming videos. I love it!<p>
