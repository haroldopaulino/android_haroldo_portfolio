        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Eye Opening</p>
        <p font16>Through all my programming experiences, I have to admit that Java has opened my eyes to a whole new reality.<p>
        <p font16>Structure, standards and a great sense of direction, that's what the language offers.<p>
        <p font16>I've learned the true value of coding well, caring for the proper object implementation, minding subprocess techniques such as threading.<p>
        <p font16>It has been a superb way to refine what I know about programming and guide me through the next step in my carreer.<p>
