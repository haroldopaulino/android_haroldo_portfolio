        <p font16>When I first started programming in JavaScript, everything was a manual process and I had to have a perfect knowledge of the DOM.<p>
        <p font16>As time went on, I've been lucky enough to see new techniques and frameworks bring a whole new life to JavaScript.<p>
        <p font16>JavaScript makes sense to me, as does the DOM, so even frameworks I am unfamiliar with, it all comes together very fast.<p>
        <p font16>There is nothing like a strong base knowledge!<p>
