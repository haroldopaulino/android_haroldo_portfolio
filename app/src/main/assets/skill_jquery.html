        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Scalable</p>
        <p font16>Working with jQuery has given me a new perspective on what can be accomplished with JavaScript and CSS on a fast paced, results driven Enterprise level development.<p>
        <p font16>It is a production cross-platform JavaScript library experience, especially because it has been designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.<p>
        <p font16>jQuery's architecture allows developers to create plug-in code to extend its function. There are thousands of jQuery plug-ins available on the Web[18] that cover a range of functions, such as Ajax helpers, Web services, datagrids, dynamic lists, XML and XSLT tools, drag and drop, events, cookie handling, and modal windows.<p>
