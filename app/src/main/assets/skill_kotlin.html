        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Kotlin</p>
        <p font16>A modern language that brings advantages from multiple platforms and the ease of use that any developer needs on a daily basis.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Full Java Interoperability</p>
        <p font16>Whenever a new language comes along, there's always the possibility that you will need to rewrite so much from day one. Kotlin plays nice. You can take you time converting every Java implementation and still keep your app functioning.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Extension Functions and Collection Filtering</p>
        <p font16>As a developer, I'm always trying to developer rich concise code, but Kotlin was made just like that, so whenever null safety and expressive code are already part of the language, it makes development solid and faster. In the development world, that's a rare combination.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Smart Cast</p>
        <p font16>Being able to write without worrying exactly what type to cast a variable is such a relief. Think of it as one less thing to worry about. Thank you Kotlin.<p>
