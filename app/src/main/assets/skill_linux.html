        <p font16>Exposed to various Linux distributions since the late 1990s, I've installed, configured, interfaced and plain worked on many Unix/Linux systems.<p>
        <p font16>Since my interaction with such operating system has been based on what I need to get my assignments done, I do have the necessary understanding to get myself through all the challenges I've faced so far.<p>
        <p font16>Among other tasks in the Unix/Linux world, I have had quite a lot of exposure to User Management, Apache HTTP Server, PHP, MySQL, FTP server, office productivity software, file management and sharing through Samba.<p>
