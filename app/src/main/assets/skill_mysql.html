        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Good Engine</p>
        <p font16>I've been deploying applications that rely on MySQL servers for 1999.<p>
        <p font16>It has served me quite well from all kinds of platforms, as it is still my public website's and personal application's main database engine.<p>
        <p font16>Along with MySQL Workbench, I get to manage any database in a matter of minutes. It's a great combo.<p>
        <p font16>I have to give credit to MySQL because throughout my carreer, it surely has educated me about database design, management, data flow, keys, triggers and connectivity.<p>
