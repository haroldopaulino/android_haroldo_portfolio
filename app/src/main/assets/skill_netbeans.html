        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Powerful IDE</p>
        <p font16>When I first started using Netbeans in 2000, it was already a solid IDE then, but as the years went by, it grew to be an extremely capable software, with intuitive actions and graphics.<p>
        <p font16>It's impressive how much you can accomplish with Netbeans today, as it still amazes me for being a free develpment platform.<p>
        <p font16>I am such a big fan of the real-time code inspection and best practices, especially how it ends up shaping me professionally.<p>
        <p font16>I truly enjoy using Netbeans.<p>
        <p font16>It's an awesome software!<p>
