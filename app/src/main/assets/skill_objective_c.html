        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Objective-C</p>
        <p font16>This language brings such solid builds to iOS. My experience has always been with fast and reliable results.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Classes are Objects</p>
        <p font16>I had the privilege of working with Objective-C for 4 years, where my understanding has expanded to where I've always knew which objects were available at any given time.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Extended Datatypes</p>
        <p font16>I wish more languages had datatypes such as NSArray, NSDictionary and NSSet, as they can do so much for larger enterprise applications. As you can tell, I do admire the power of Objective-C.<p>
