        <p font16>I've been immersed in PHP since 2000 and I really enjoy it.<p>
        <p font16>It's such a forgiving language, which gives me the flexibility I need to get things going.<p>
        <p font16>After working with so many cowboy coders, code-monkeys or programmers who just want to “throw code out and see what sticks”, it pays off to have been educated from other non-forgiving languages enough to give me a solid understanding and sense of responsibility when it comes to stick to official coding standards and be consistent about it.<p>
        <p font16>I prime for official standards and honestly believe that a team can surely win when all involved follows such rules.<p>
        <p font16>PHP is extremely powerful and yet, very simple to code.<p>
        <p font16>Awesome language!<p>
