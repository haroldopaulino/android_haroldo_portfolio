        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>RASPBERRY Pi</p>
        <p font16>Microprocessors and external electronic devices programming is not only rewarding, but also a lot of fun!<p>
        <p font16>My exposure began with the raspberry pi 3, which was because of a work project that involved the design of a print server that would allow for remote connections within a T1 data line.<p>
        <p font16>I got very familiar with CUPS and built a Java based set of applications for my current employer, as a multi client server software, which is still considered as a backup plan in the event of the new Java based system I also built had any issues.<p>
        <p font16>I also built the first version of my home automation prototype using the PIs GPIOs, controlling solid state relays and voltage dividers.<p>
