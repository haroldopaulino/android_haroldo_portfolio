        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Useful</p>
        <p font16>I have implemented quite a few applications to use the SOAP protocol in order to communicate with and perform transactions.<p>
        <p font16>As long as it's properly done, SOAP is a breeze.<p>
        <p font16>Among some systems in which I am/was a developer, the communication has been positive, so the application can retrieve and post data.<p>
        <p font16>Great protocol!<p>
