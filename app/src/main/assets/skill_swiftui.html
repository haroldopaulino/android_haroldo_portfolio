        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Cross-platform UI</p>
        <p font16>Who said you can't use the same UI for iOS, macOS, tvOS? You sure can, and that's only a small example of what SwiftUI can do.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>No Auto Layout Worries</p>
        <p font16>How many times have an app's auto layout made the wrong decision? No more. SwiftUI gives you the power to easily control all your layout. The power is yours!<p>
