        <p font16>Early in my carreer I realized how necessary it would be to have a process that works for various applications at once.<p>
        <p font16>I came across SOAP and immediately realized the virtue of having a web service at my disposal.<p>
        <p font16>Soon after, I learned that I could design my own web service, so I could better handle my web requests across platforms.<p>
        <p font16>When integrated with the right data, most likely in JSON or XML, web services are the way of the future.<p>
        <p font16>They are pretty universal these days, but extremelly efficient.<p>
        <p font16>I love writing my own web services, especially when deploying mobile and web applications.<p>
        <p font16>Productivity is great!<p>
