        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>First Class OS</p>
        <p font16>Since 1995, I've been working with MS-DOS, then Microsoft Windows.<p>
        <p font16>All it's distributions had such unique features, but the more recent ones have are solid and very reliable.<p>
        <p font16>From account/power/network management to command prompt usage, I've experienced almost every aspect of the operating systems.<p>
        <p font16>Throughout my MS-DOS/Windows development, I have even setup quite a few different servers, such as Apache HTTP/PHP, MySQL, IIS, SQL, DB2, FTP, SMTP, POP3, File Server, Media Server... you get the point!<p>
        <p font16>Microsoft Windows is an elegant operating system.<p>
