        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Xcode</p>
        <p font16>After decades of software engineering experience, I can say that Xcode has earned such a big name for itself, because of all the features and capabilities, readily available.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Source Editor and Assistant Editor</p>
        <p font16>It's the middle of a project and I've forgotten what a specific command is called. No problem. Xcode has Advanced Code Completion, which has saved me so much time, as well as when the Assistant Editor displays files that are most helpful to me, based on the code I'm actively editing.<p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Asset Catalog</p>
        <p font16>Instead of worrying about where and how to store assets for the project, I know the Xcode will compile the asset catalog into the most efficient bundle for final distribution. This is huge for me, as I've never had any issues with assets management.<p>
        <p font16>If you haven't had the chance to use Xcode for native iOS/macOS/watchOS/tvOS development, wonder no more, this tool is a great.<p>
