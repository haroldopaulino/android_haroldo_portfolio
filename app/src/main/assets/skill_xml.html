        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>XML</p>
        <p font20 bold fullWidth left>Handy markup</p>
        <p font16>I've started parsing my first XML documents in 2000, when it had grown in popularity at the time.<p>
        <p font16>Back then, I had to write my own parser engine, but a few years later, XML had become a recommended choice in regards to internet data transport.<p>
        <p font16>Even though there were critics of it's verbosity and complexity, more languages had developed their own parsers, including PHP, which I used frequently.<p>
        <p font16>I believe XML is quite a universal way to transport data these days and I am using it in various systems.<p>
