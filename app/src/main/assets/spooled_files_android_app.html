        <p font16>
            This is a manager app for IBM i Spooled Files from the available queues.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            Each file selection allows the user to View, Hold, Delete or Release.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            With very flexible connection parameters, the user can take advantage of dozens of customizations upon connecting, to allow pre-formatted and filtered data.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This app was written in Java, exploring OOP, abstraction, SQLite, async executions and the powerful JT400 API, which makes possible to fully connect, execute commands and programs against IBM i servers.
