        <p font20 bold fullWidth center>Utah IBM i Professionals Association (UIIPA) Website</p>
        <p font16>
            I host this website in my private web server in my house. I also manage the DNS and SSL implementation and renewal.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            This is a non-profit organization with focus on IBM i servers ecosystems.

            This website is based on Wordpress, but I've also custom built some RESTful services, so the UIIPA Android app can query the site for content.
        </p>
        <p font16>
            What better way to give back to the community than serving such a great non-profit organization?
