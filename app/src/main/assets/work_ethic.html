            If there is something I can vouch for, it's hard work.

            Discipline is one the fundamental principles I strive to live by, commiting myself to my current projects and prioritizing their completion.

            Quality is a given when I put so much devotion into my current tasks. I try my best to deliver the highest quality work I can. Never settle for less.

            Responsibility when making daily decisions, both on a personal and professional level, is just part of who I am.

            Some of my experience both professional and personal has involved great teamwork, where the team often becomes my family; Other environments were based on a more self-centered approach, having independent individuals working close to each other, but not together, producing individualized, non-teamwork results. Either way, I try my best to excel at both approaches by keeping my tasks straight, listening to what my superiors except of me and moving forward as fast as I can. However, I do love the real teamwork approach, in which all members work unison by being willing to adapt, contribute and assimilate the team's elected style, so there is never an individual style because the team's way is often the best way.

            When I look back at all my experiences, there is a sense of honesty I want those around me to trust me and who I am, even if it means a diminished social status. Whenever someone speaks of me, they would immediately know that, above all, I do have integrity.
